## About me
I am a Staff Researcher with the Distributed Scheduling and Data Engine Lab at Huawei Research Canada. I obtained the PhD degree in Computer Science from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca){:target="_blank"}, Canada, supervised by [Prof. Raouf Boutaba](https://rboutaba.cs.uwaterloo.ca){:target="_blank"}, and the B.Sc. degree in computer science and engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). In the past, I interned at Google and IBM Research – USA, and INRIA – France. I was also a Lecturer of computer science and engineering at BUET. My research interests span several areas of systems and networking, including network function virtualization, network virtualization, software-defined networking, and large-scale decentralized systems. I received several recognitions for my research including, the best paper award of IEEE NetSoft in 2019, the best paper award of IEEE/ACM/IFIP CNSM in 2017 and 2019, and the best paper runner-up award at the IEEE ICDCS HotPOST workshop 2013.
